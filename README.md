##  Featured Projects  
----------
### Javascript Basic Projects

These projects demonstrate my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, events, and data handling through small but practical apps like a color flipper, counter, and to-do list, all designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and build a solid foundation for advanced development.
